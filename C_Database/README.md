A simple Database written in C

Accessible through the terminal when executed.
Allows User to input information about themselves, such as their username, email, and user id

The data is then stored in to a data structure called a table.

This table is then represented visually in terminal for user abstraction

This Project was dedicated to better my knowledge on data management and understanding of structs, pointers, dynamic allocated memory,
and other applications needed for development in C.

Through this application I recognized that the use of databases is highly important. Without it there wouldn't be any data retention,
and without testing and constant montioring and implementation it could be raise concerns for data safety.

With further development I plan to use this database as an external structure to hold data for my website which will be created later on
